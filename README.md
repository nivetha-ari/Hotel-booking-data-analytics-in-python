# Hotel Booking Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze hotel booking data to gain insights into the factors influencing cancellation rates. The dataset used contains information about hotel bookings, including various attributes such as booking dates, customer demographics, and booking channels.

## Problem Statement

The hospitality industry faces challenges with high cancellation rates, impacting revenue and resource planning. Understanding the underlying factors contributing to cancellations is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate this issue and optimize operations.

## Approach

1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset is subjected to thorough cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring data quality for analysis.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and correlations among different variables. EDA helps in understanding the distribution of data and uncovering insights that can guide further analysis.

3. **Visualization**: Utilizing various visualization techniques such as bar chart, pie chart, and line plot to visually represent the data and highlight significant findings. Visualizations aid in communicating complex relationships and patterns effectively.

4. **Insights Generation**: Drawing insights from the analysis to understand the factors contributing to higher cancellation rates. These insights can inform decision-making processes aimed at reducing cancellations and improving overall efficiency.

The dataset used for this analysis consists of the following features:
- **Hotel**: Type of hotel (City hotel or Resort hotel)
- **Lead Time**: Number of days between booking date and arrival date
- **Arrival Date**: Date of arrival
- **Adults**: Number of adults
- **Children**: Number of children
- **Babies**: Number of babies
- **Market Segment**: Market segment designation
- **Distribution Channel**: Booking distribution channel
- **Is Repeated Guest**: Indicates if the booking is from a repeated guest
- **Cancellation**: Indicates if the booking was canceled (1 for canceled, 0 for not canceled)
